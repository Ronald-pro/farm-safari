						Farm Safari Advances the United Nations Sustainable Development

							<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-700">
								<li>
									<strong>Goal :</strong> Ensure sustainable consumption and
									production patterns Farm Safari promotes self-sufficient
									farming by helping farmers grow a variety of crops for
									household consumption and local markets. We emphasize
									responsible land use, organic composting, water conservation,
									and sustainable livestock management to minimize environmental
									impact.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Goal :</strong> Take urgent action to combat climate
									change and its impacts By planting trees and adopting
									regenerative farming techniques, Farm Safari helps farmers
									mitigate climate change. Trees absorb carbon, restore soil
									fertility, and create climate-resilient landscapes that
									protect against extreme weather conditions.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Goal :</strong> Protect, restore, and promote
									sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems Our model combats
									deforestation and soil degradation by encouraging farmers to
									integrate trees into their farms. This approach not only
									revitalizes farmland but also conserves biodiversity,
									providing habitat for pollinators and wildlife while reducing
									reliance on forest resources.
